    "## **UTBot**\n",
    "### **The Logic Behind it:**\n",
    "The UTBot indicator is more carefull in it's signals overall the higher the key value is.\n",
    "* The key value is setting the overall size of the threshold, the higher the key value the greater the threshold is, and accordingly it is harder for the trailing stop to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "    that is because when the threshold is bigger, the trailing stop doesnt change unless the current close is greater than the previous trailing stop and the previous close is smaller than the previous trailing stop, or the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "    when both the current and the previous close are greater than the previous trailing stop or smaller than it the trailing stop can only will change only if the difference between the current close and the previous close is greater than the current threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "    and when the key value is greater the threshold becomes greater aswell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UTBot indicator is more carefull in it's signals over the passing of time the longer the ATR Period is set.\n",
    "* The ATR Period is setting the weakening of the effect each TR value has on the threshold, meaning the more the TR values \"agree\" with each other, the more representetive the ATR value of the TRs' values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    from this comes to play how does this value affect the threshold, the more there are TR values that are greater, the higher the threshold, and the same applys for when the there are more TR values that are smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "    over time the threshold changes less speratically the greater the ATR Period because there are more TR values to keep the ATR and the threshold values similar to their previous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    in other words the threshold is more stable over time when the longer the ATR Period is.\n",
    "\n",
    "in the video there are 2 UTBot indictors used, both have the same key value, but the indicator that gives the Buy signal is more carefull than the indicator that gives the Sell signal when it \"decides\" to give the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "this means that to give a Buy signal the indicators wait for longer than for giving a Sell signal, once there is some slight loss you should Sell but when there is there some gain you should wait and see if this gain is consistent enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, this indicator finds relatively safe opportunities to perform Buy and Sell signals\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How it works:**\n",

    "## STC Osilator\n",
    "### The Logic Behind it:\n",
    "The STC Osilator relys on the difference between the short-term $EMA$ ($FastEMA$) and the long-term $EMA$ ($SlowEMA$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each $EMA$ for period $n$ at time $t$ is calculated: $$EMA_t^n = (close_t - EMA_{t-1}^n)\\times\\frac{Constant}{1+n} + EMA_{t-1}^n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $$EMA_{\\,n-1}^n=SMA_{n-1}^n=\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\frac{Close_{t-i}}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $\\frac{Constant}{1+n}$ is set (usually) to be in the range $(\\frac{1}{1+n},\\;1]$, meaning $Constant \\in (1,\\; 1+n]$ (here we'll focus only on the cases that these values dont exceed these ranges)\n",
    "\n",
    "This calculation means that the $EMA_t^n$ is an updated version of its predecessor where the value of the predecessor is reduced and the value of $Close_t$ is taken into acount in a greater manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way the affect that all of the $Close$ values that are previous to time $t$ is not lost but only reduced to make place for the affect of the $Close$ value of time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The longer the period of the $EMA$ is the less sporadic the increase or decrease of the $EMA$ values, which leads to say that the meaning of each $EMA_t^n$ is in a sense the actual value of the $Close_t$ adjusted accordingly to the set period, the longer the period the more persistent the affect all of the $Close_t$ that are in that period on this adjusted $Close_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms an $EMA$ with a long period clings more on the past values of the $close$ than an $EMA$ with a short period.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is a relatively great difference between the short-term and the long-term $EMA$'s (also called $MacdDiff$) this means that on the long-term the $Close$ values are changing in one direction (Positive or Negative) and on the short-term the $Close$ values are changing in the opposite direction.\n",
    "* If the short-term $EMA$ is significantly higher than the long-term $EMA$ this can only mean that a slight rise has been detected, and if the difference between the 2 $EMA$'s continues to grow over time this means that the rise that was detected stays strong and is reliable to take into acount when deciding on a signal.\n",
    "* If the short-term $EMA$ is significantly lower than the long-term $EMA$ this can only mean that a slight drop has been detected, and if the difference between the 2 $EMA$'s continues to grow over time this means that the drop that was detected stays strong and is reliable to take into acount when deciding on a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here comes in to play the smoothing process, the normalization process and the period that the STC Osilator is set to (the $STClength$).\n",
    "* The smoothing process makes it so that the $MacdDiff_t$'s are less sporadic when compared to one another, this relatively to the set $SmoothingFactor$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The greater the $SmoothingFactor$ the less the affect of the smoothing process, and vice versa.\n",
    "* The normalization process makes it so that the smoothed $MacdDiff_t$'s will be represented as a precentile of each smoothed $MacdDiff_t$ within all of the smoothed $MacdDiff_t$'s in the period that is set as the $STClength$.\n",
    "* The $STClength$ determins how many $MacdDiff_t$ is taken into acount when performing the normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This finalization reformats the differences between the $EMA$ of the same $t$ and different period to be values between 0 and a 100, and keeps the relative meaning of the differences that was represented before the formating:\n",
    "* The higher the value is relatively to 50 the stronger the rise is, and accordingly the more reliable it is for making a decision on a signal.\n",
    "* The lower the value is relati to 50 the stronger the drop is, and accordingly the more reliable it is for making a decision on a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the video:\n",
    "* When the UTBot gives a Buy signal at time $t$, the STC Osilator's normalized & smoothed $MacdDiff_t$ is lower than 25 (meaning fairly certain of a drop in the $close$ value) and the $MacdDiff_t$ is greater than the $MacdDiff_{t-1}$ (meaning the drop is weakening but still exists) we would want to apply that Buy signal.\n",
    "* When the UTBot gives a Sell signal at time $t$, the STC Osilator's normalized & smoothed $MacdDiff_t$ is higher than 75 (meaning fairly certain of a rise in the $close$ value) and the $MacdDiff_t$ is smaller than the $MacdDiff_{t-1}$ (meaning the rise is weakening but still exists) we would want to apply that Sell signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, this indicator helps to detect a significant enough rise or drop to perform apon Buy or Sell signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "1. Calculate the $FastEMA_t$ and the $SlowEMA_t$ of the $Close$ value for every sample $t$ in the data relaitve to the set $Fast\\:Length$ and $Slow\\:Length$, both of the EMA's are calculated as shown in class where the n is set as their apropriate $^{\\{Type\\}}Length$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here we used the ***ewm*** method combined with ***mean***, as shown in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the $MacdDiff_t$ for every sample $t$ in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **MacdDiff Formula:** $\\; MacdDiff_t = FastEMA_t - SlowEMA_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Normalize and Smooth (twice) the resulting line and each point making that line call $NormSmoothMacdDiff_t$ that is created when ploting the $MacdDiff_t$ values using the set $SmoothFactor$ and $STCLen$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Set the signals in accordance to the following rules:\n",
    "* When $NormSmoothMacdDiff_t>0.75\\:$ **&** $\\:NormSmoothMacdDiff_t<NormSmoothMacdDiff_{t-1}$ set $Signal_t=Sell$\n",
    "* When $NormSmoothMacdDiff_t<0.25\\:$ **&** $\\:NormSmoothMacdDiff_t>NormSmoothMacdDiff_{t-1}$ set $Signal_t=Buy$\n",
    "* In any other case set $Signal_t=DoNothing$\n",

    "The strategy is to apply the given signals when a UTBot indicator and a STC indicator both give the same signal, this double check is to insure that the signal that both indicators give are not False signals which will cause loss instead of gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy relys on 2 key forces:\n",
    "1. Stability of prices sporadicity (through UTBot)  \n",
    "    The stability of prices sporadicity gives an indication whether the value of an investment will be calm and less likely to change or sporadic in its value.\n",
    "    \n",

    "    The Rise & Drop consistency gives an indication whether the rate of change of an investment value is positive or negative and how consistent is this rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The strategy detects an indication of an active decrease of the rate of change of an investment value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both forces indicate gain potential that could be utilized, and both forces rely on accumulated values across certain time periods.\n",
    "\n",
